# Prepress Preparation for Healthcare Packaging

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **prepress workflow** for healthcare folding carton packaging. It focuses on reviewing customer-supplied artwork, identifying and correcting prepress issues, and producing a **print-ready PDF** following industry standards.

The project simulates receiving a **customer digital file** and preparing it for production using **Adobe InDesign and Acrobat Pro**, while demonstrating awareness of Illustrator and Photoshop for vector and image adjustments if needed.

## Objectives
- Review customer-supplied print artwork
- Identify prepress issues
- Correct color, resolution, bleed, and font problems
- Perform preflight validation
- Generate print-ready PDF (PDF/X-1a standard)
- Prepare files suitable for **CTP workflow**
- Document all steps and deliverables

## Tools & Technologies
- **Adobe InDesign** – layout, bleed, preflight, PDF/X export
- **Adobe Acrobat Pro** – PDF preflight, production validation
- **Adobe Illustrator (awareness)** – vector/dieline edits if required
- **Adobe Photoshop (awareness)** – image color correction or retouch
- **CMYK Color Management**
- **PDF/X Standards**
